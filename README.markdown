#Video Chat with ConnectionPeer API, WebSockets and Node.js

The source is a demo appliaction based on [Ericcson Labs video chat demo](https://labs.ericsson.com/apis/web-real-time-communication/).
I used [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO) websockets implementation.

Run server with the following command: 

	+	for productio - `NODE_ENV=production node index.js`  
	+ for development (more debug info etc) - `NODE_ENV=development node index.js`  

Server will be runing at http://localhost:8080/.

No more configuration is required. 

Code comments are in Polish language for now. I will fix it soon...
